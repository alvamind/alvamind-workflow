## Known Issues

### Technical Limitations
1. Limited support for complex branching logic
2. No persistent state between workflow runs
3. No built-in caching mechanism
4. Limited YAML support for advanced features

### Usability Concerns
1. Error messages could be more detailed for certain failures
2. No visualization of workflow structure before execution
3. Limited documentation for advanced scenarios

## Current Status

The project has a solid foundation with working core features and now supports conditional execution and dependencies between steps. These new features enable more sophisticated workflows where steps can depend on the results of previous steps and be conditionally executed based on dynamic context. The test suite has been expanded to cover these new capabilities. Next steps are focused on enhancing the YAML syntax to support these features in configuration files and improving documentation.

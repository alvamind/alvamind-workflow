# ðŸŒŠ Alvamind Workflow - Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is currently in active development with a functional foundation that includes:

1. **Core Workflow Engine**: The base execution system is operational
2. **Dual Interface**: Both YAML configuration and programmatic API are available
3. **Error Handling**: Basic error recovery with interactive options is implemented
4. **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for workflow execution

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the WorkflowBuilder for programmatic workflow creation
- Added support for parallel command execution
- Integrated detailed timing information for each step
- Enhanced error reporting with colorful console output
- Added interactive mode for error handling

## Active Decisions

### 1. Error Handling Strategy
Currently using an interactive approach that allows users to:
- Retry failed commands
- Enter alternative commands
- Skip non-critical steps
- Abort the workflow

This approach balances automation with flexibility for recovery.

### 2. Configuration Format
Using YAML as the primary configuration format due to:
- Human readability
- Widespread adoption
- Easy structure for workflow steps
- Simplicity for basic use cases

### 3. Progress Reporting
Using chalk for colorful terminal output with:
- Step counters (e.g., `[1/5]`)
- Timing information
- Success/failure indicators
- Real-time progress updates

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Enhanced Parallel Execution**: Improve parallel command handling with better status reporting
2. **Callback System**: Expand support for command callbacks to enable conditional workflows
3. **Documentation**: Complete user documentation with examples

### Future Considerations
1. **Plugin System**: Allow for extensibility through plugins
2. **Workspace Support**: Multiple workflow definitions in a workspace
3. **Advanced Branching**: More sophisticated conditional execution paths
4. **Configuration Validation**: Schema validation for YAML configurations

## Open Questions

1. Should we support multi-stage workflows with dependencies between stages?
2. How can we improve the test coverage for critical components?
3. Should we consider adding a web-based UI for workflow monitoring?
4. What additional integration points would be valuable for users?
